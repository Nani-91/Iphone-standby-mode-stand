# Iphone-standby-mode-stand
When you sleep, you put your phone on this stand and are unable to use it as a clock with the iPhone's new feature (standby mode). This 3d model hides the wires and makes it look neater and aesthetically pleasing. It also ensures the phone fits perfectly without needing it to scrape the plastic.
Dec 3: I got done just making a "fake" prototype, and I need to submit it on Hack Club so I can get the grant and finally get the measurements on the phone and make it more perfect.
